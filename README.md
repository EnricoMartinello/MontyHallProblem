# MontyHallProblem
The Monty Hall problem is a counter-intuitive statistics puzzle.

* There are 3 doors, behind which are two goats and a car.
* You pick a door (call it door 1). You’re hoping for the car of course.
* Monty Hall, the game show host, examines the other doors (2 & 3) and opens one with a goat. (If both doors have goats, he picks randomly.)

Here’s the game: Do you stick with door 1 (original guess) or switch to the unopened door? Does it matter?
Surprisingly, the odds aren’t 50-50. If you switch doors you’ll win 2/3 of the time!

## Solution
There is a 1/3 chance of the car being behind door number 1 and a 2/3 chance that the car isn’t behind door number 1. After Monty Hall opens door number 2 to reveal a goat, there’s still a 1/3 chance that the car is behind door number 1 and a 2/3 chance that the car isn’t behind door number 1. A 2/3 chance that the car isn’t behind door number 1 is a 2/3 chance that the car is behind door number 3.

## Summary
Here’s the key points to understanding the Monty Hall puzzle:

Two choices are 50-50 when you know nothing about them
Monty helps us by “filtering” the bad choices on the other side. It’s a choice of a random guess and the “Champ door” that’s the best on the other side.
In general, more information means you re-evaluate your choices.
The fatal flaw in the Monty Hall paradox is not taking Monty’s filtering into account, thinking the chances are the same before and after. But the goal isn’t to understand this puzzle — it’s to realize how subsequent actions & information challenge previous decisions. Happy math.
